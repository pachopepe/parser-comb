Parser combinators

This is the presentation I made for FP-Colombia Meetup March 4, 2017.
The parser combinators code was taken or adapted from _Languages and
   Compilers, Swierstra, and Jeuring, 2011, chapter 3_. The Json data
   type was taken from Real World Haskell Applications, O'Sullivan,
   Stewart, and Goerzen.
